# :mirror: WordMirror :mirror:
This program is designed to search through a dictionary file and identify palindromes and palingrams. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence of characters that reads the same forwards and backwards (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization), while a palingram is a type of anagram that forms a palindrome when the letters are rearranged.
## Highlights
The provided *wordlist.txt* file is a copy of the unix dictionary file found on my computer at '/usr/share/dict/words'\
This program is meant for practicing coding in python and to have fun
## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Have current version of python installed
3. Run code ``` python palingramsfinder.py``` to find palingrams
4. Run code ``` python palindromefinder.py``` to find palindromes
## Reference
The inspiration for this code comes from the book *Impractical Python Projects* by Lee Vaughan
